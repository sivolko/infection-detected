## üìù Style Guidelines

### Code Style

**Jekyll/Liquid Templates:**
```liquid
{% if condition %}
  <div class="container">
    {{ content }}
  </div>
{% endif %}
```

**SCSS:**
```scss
.component {
  property: value;
  
  &__element {
    property: value;
  }
  
  &--modifier {
    property: value;
  }
}
```

**JavaScript:**
```javascript
// Use modern ES6+ syntax
const myFunction = (param) => {
  // Clear, concise comments
  return result;
};
```

### File Naming Conventions

- **Blog posts**: `YYYY-MM-DD-post-title-slug.md`
- **Components**: `component-name.html`
- **Stylesheets**: `_component-name.scss`
- **JavaScript**: `module-name.js`
- **Images**: `descriptive-name.jpg` (lowercase, hyphens)

### Directory Structure Rules

```
_includes/     ‚Üí Reusable HTML components
_layouts/      ‚Üí Page templates
_sass/         ‚Üí SCSS partials (prefix with _)
assets/css/    ‚Üí Compiled CSS (don't edit directly)
assets/js/     ‚Üí JavaScript modules
assets/images/ ‚Üí Optimized images only
docs/          ‚Üí Documentation (not built)
```

## üìù Commit Message Guidelines

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

### Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Types

- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, no logic change)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks
- `ci`: CI/CD changes

### Examples

```bash
# Feature
git commit -m "feat(posts): add social sharing buttons"

# Bug fix
git commit -m "fix(images): resolve lazy loading on Safari"

# Documentation
git commit -m "docs(readme): update installation instructions"

# Performance
git commit -m "perf(images): optimize image compression script"

# Refactor
git commit -m "refactor(css): reorganize SCSS file structure"
```

### Best Practices

- Use present tense: "add feature" not "added feature"
- Use imperative mood: "move cursor to" not "moves cursor to"
- Keep subject line under 50 characters
- Capitalize the subject line
- Don't end subject line with a period
- Separate subject from body with a blank line
- Wrap body at 72 characters
- Use body to explain *what* and *why*, not *how*

## üñºÔ∏è Image Guidelines

### Before Adding Images

1. **Optimize first**: Run `npm run optimize:images`
2. **Use appropriate formats**:

   - File size: < 200KB per image
4. **Naming**: Use descriptive, lowercase, hyphenated names

### Image Optimization

```bash
# Optimize all images
npm run optimize:images

# Manual optimization with ImageMagick
convert input.jpg -strip -interlace Plane -quality 85 -resize 1200> output.jpg

# WebP conversion
cwebp -q 85 input.jpg -o output.webp
```
