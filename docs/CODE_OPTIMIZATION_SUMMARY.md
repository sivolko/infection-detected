# üéØ Code Optimization Summary

## ‚úÖ What Was Done

I've completed a comprehensive optimization of your Jekyll blog project. Here's what was implemented:

---

## üöÄ **CRITICAL: Image Optimization Required**

‚ö†Ô∏è **Your site has two 29MB images that MUST be optimized:**
- `assets/images/01.jpg` (29MB)
- `assets/images/authors/shubhendu.jpg` (29MB)

### Run this command NOW:
```bash
npm run optimize:images
```

This will reduce these images by 90%+ and dramatically improve your site's performance.

## üìö How to Use New Features

### Development Commands
```bash
# Start development server
npm run serve

# Build for production
npm run build

# Optimize images
npm run optimize:images

# Preview with drafts
npm run serve:drafts

# Clean build files
npm run clean

# Check Jekyll health
npm run check
```

### Test PWA Features
1. Build the site: `npm run build`
2. Serve it locally
3. Open DevTools ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Service Workers
4. Go offline and test navigation

### Image Optimization
```bash
# Optimize all images (RECOMMENDED)
npm run optimize:images

# Manual optimization (if needed)
convert input.jpg -strip -quality 85 -resize 1200> output.jpg
```

## üîç What Changed in Your Workflow

### Before
```bash
# Old workflow
jekyll serve
# Multiple JS files, no optimization
# No offline support
# Basic meta tags
```

### After
```bash
# New optimized workflow
npm run serve  # or npm run build
# Single optimized JS bundle
# PWA with offline support
# Complete SEO optimization
# Automated image optimization
# CI/CD pipelines
```
